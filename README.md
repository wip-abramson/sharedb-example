# ShareDb Example

Very basic example using a ShareDb instance with a React frontend.

To run server:

* npm install
* npm start

To run client:

* cd client
* npm install
* npm start


 Still to test - https://github.com/share/sharedb-mongo
 Including checking how version control works.
 
 Also this seems interesting, although potentially heavyweight - https://github.com/startupjs/startupjs

This example might also be useful - https://github.com/share/sharedb/tree/master/examples/rich-text
